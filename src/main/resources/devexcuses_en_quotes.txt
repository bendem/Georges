I couldn't find any library that can even do that
The problem seems to be with our legacy software
That error means it was successful
I forgot to commit the code that fixes that
Oh, that was only supposed to be a placeholder
It's a remote vendor issue
The program has never collected that information
The code is compiling
No one told me so I was forced to assume which way to do that
The WYSIWYG must have produced an invalid output
The marketing department made us put that there
I have too many other high priority things to do right now
You can't use that version on your system
I haven't touched that code in weeks
What did you type in wrong to get it to crash?
It would take too long to rewrite the code from scratch
That worked perfectly when I developed it
I'm not sure as I've never had a look at how that works before
It's a known bug with the server software
It's just some unlucky coincidence
It must be a hardware problem
We should have updated our software years ago
I can't make that a priority right now
Our code quality is no worse than anyone else in the industry
How is that possible?
I thought you signed off on that?
Actually, that's a feature
I haven't had any experience with that before
It's never done that before
I did a quick fix last time but it broke when we rebooted
I couldn't find any examples of how that can be done anywhere else in the project
It's a known bug with the programming language
I must not have understood what you were asking for
Everything looks fine my end
Nobody asked me how long it would actually take
The existing design makes it difficult to do the right thing
I broke that deliberately to do some testing
That wouldn't be economically feasible
You're doing it wrong
We outsourced that months ago
My time was split in a way that meant I couldn't do either project properly
It's never shown unexpected behaviour like this before
It was working in my head
That wasn't in the original specification
The download must have been corrupted
The request must have dropped some packets
There was too little data to bother with the extra functionality at the time
It worked yesterday
It's a character encoding issue
I was told to stop working on that when something important came up
It's a third party application issue
We didn't have enough time to peer review the final changes
I must have been stress testing our production server
The user must not know how to use it
That behaviour is in the original specification
I thought I finished that
What did I tell you about using parts of the system you don't understand?
Oh, you said you DIDN'T want that to happen?
It works, but it's not been tested
It's not a code problem - our users need more training
I can have a look but there's a lot of if statements in that code!
Well done, you found my easter egg!
The project manager said no one would want that feature
The third party API is not responding
The third party documentation is wrong
The client must have been hacked
Did you check for a virus on your system?
I'm still working on that as we speak
That code was written by the last guy
There must be something strange in your data
Management insisted we wouldn't need to waste our time writing unit tests
Where were you when the program blew up?
I usually get a notification when that happens
THIS can't be the source of THAT
I didn't create that part of the program
Even though it doesn't work, how does it feel?
Maybe somebody forgot to pay our hosting company
I thought he knew the context of what I was talking about
I can't test everything
Oh, that was just a temporary fix
You must have the wrong version
Well, at least it displays a very pretty error
I haven't had the chance to run that code yet
That's not a bug it's a configuration issue
I'm surprised that was working at all
Why do you want to do it that way?
It must be because of a leap year
That's the fault of the graphic designer
I have never seen that before in my life
Nobody has ever complained about it
I'm not familiar with it so I didn't fix it in case I made it worse
Well at least we know not to try that again
That was literally a one in a million error
I'm not getting any error codes
It probably won't happen again
It's an unexpected emergent behaviour of several last minute abstractions
It works for me
The person responsible doesn't work here anymore
That's interesting, how did you manage to make it do that?
This is a previously known bug you told me not to work on yet
The third party documentation doesn't exist
The unit test doesn't cover that eventuality
That important email must have been marked as spam
I'm surprised it works as well as it does
That feature was slated for phase two
It can't be broken, it passes all unit tests
It must be a firewall issue
There were too many developers working on that same thing
The specifications were ambiguous
You must be missing some of the dependencies
Your browser must be caching the old content
I'll have to fix that at a later date
It must be because of a leap second
In the interest of efficiency I only check my email for that on a Friday
It's a browser compatibility issue
Our redundant systems must have failed as well
I didn't anticipate that I would make any errors
Our internet connection must not be working
Don't worry, that value is only wrong half of the time
Our hardware is too slow to cope with demand
That isn't covered by my job description
I thought I fixed that
It's always been like that
I couldn't find any examples of how that can be done anywhere online
This code was not supposed to go in to production yet
We spent three months debugging it because we only had one month to build it
Well, that's a first
I was just fixing that
The original specification contained conflicting requirements
I told you yesterday it would be done by the end of today
There's currently a problem with our hosting company
Somebody must have changed my code
I heard there was a solar flare today
I had to do the project backwards as people demanded results out of order
That feature would be outside of the scope
I didn't receive a ticket for it
I haven't been able to reproduce that
That's already fixed it just hasn't taken effect yet
The client wanted it changed at the last minute
The project manager told me to do it that way
That process requires human oversight that nobody was providing
The accounting department must have cancelled that subscription
You must have done something wrong
That code seemed so simple I didn't think it needed testing
It would have taken twice as long to build it properly
